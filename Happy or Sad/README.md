## Project Description
This project demonstrates the potential of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in image classification tasks. Specifically, a CNN-based model is developed to classify images of people into two categories: happy and sad. The project involves:

- Loading and preprocessing image data.
- Constructing a CNN model for binary classification.
- Training and evaluating the model.
- Visualizing the results and model performance.

### Key Aspects Simulated:
- **Loading Data:** Import necessary libraries and load image data for training and testing.
- **Sample Display:** Display a sample of the dataset.
- **Data Preparation:** Normalize and split the data into training, validation, and test sets.
- **Model Construction:** Build and compile the CNN model.
- **Training:** Train the model with the training data and validate with validation data.
- **Metrics Visualization:** Plot the loss and accuracy metrics during training.
- **Predictions:** Evaluate the model with test data and display results.

## Results
The project provides key metrics on the performance of the CNN model in classifying images as happy or sad. The results include accuracy, F1-score, sensitivity, and specificity, which help in understanding the model's effectiveness and identifying areas for improvement.

## Conclusions
The "Happy or Sad" project successfully demonstrates the use of CNNs for image classification, particularly in identifying emotions from images. This project emphasizes the importance of:

- **Normalization and Data Partitioning:** Essential for good model performance.
- **Continuous Learning:** Enhances technical skills and prepares for future challenges in complex systems modeling.
- **Exploring New Tools and Methods:** Provides more efficient and accurate solutions in different contexts.
